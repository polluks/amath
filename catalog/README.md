Localization support
====================

**Amath needs translators.**

If you want to help translating amath to your own language, you can fill in the catalog translation files (.ct) for your country.

The catalog files are distributed under Creative Common License and therefor you are free to reuse texts from Wikipedia.

Additional language and catalog files are also accepted. To create your own catalog translation file, look at examples in the English version. Also take a look at [Flexcat](http://sourceforge.net/projects/flexcat/).

Please send contributions to carsten.larsen [ at ] mail.com and I will merge them into the source.
