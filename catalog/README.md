Localization support
====================

**Amath needs translators.**

If you want to help translating amath to your own language, you can fill in the catalog translation files (.ct) for your country.

The catalog files are distributed under [Creative Common License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode) and therefor you are [free to reuse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights#Re-use_of_text] texts from wikipedia.org.

Additional language and catalog files are also accepted. To create your own catalog translation file, look at examples in the English version. Also take a look at [Flexcat](http://sourceforge.net/projects/flexcat/).

Please send contributions to carsten.larsen [ at ] mail.com and I will merge them into the source.
